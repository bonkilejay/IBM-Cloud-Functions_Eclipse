#Eclipse PLugin for IBM Cloud Functions

This is a prototype extension for Eclipse that enables complete round trip cycles for authoring IBM CLoud Functions actions inside the Eclipse IDE. The key point for this extension is that it has full round trip for IBM Cloud Functions actions without ever leaving the IDE and makes dev cycles far shorter and easier. It also works for both Node.js and Python Actions on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
